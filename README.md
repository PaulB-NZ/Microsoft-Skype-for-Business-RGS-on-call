The RGS On Call script was created for an IT Service desk to change the on call person on a weekly basis. Simply edit the PS1 file based on the comments in the file to match your environment and you will have a simple way of switching the on call engineer\support person.

Be sure to take note of the comments in the PS1 file to add the Menu selection items as well as the on Call Engineers and their afterhoure DID's.
